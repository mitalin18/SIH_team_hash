    <p>While each engineering specialty requires different courses, licenses and other qualifications, every aspiring engineer must complete these five steps when pursuing this career path.

        1. Earn the appropriate degree
        The first step in becoming an engineer is to earn a bachelor's degree. Many future engineers choose to pursue degrees in programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), which is the official organization that accredits engineering programs in the U.S. You should get your bachelor's degree in the field of study you want to work in, such as civil or chemical engineering. Some engineering specialties may require you to have a master's degree in your specific field in addition to a bachelor's degree.
        
        2. Take and pass the NCEES FE exam
        Once you graduate from an engineering program with a bachelor's degree, you can take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam offered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) to become licensed to work as an engineer-in-training or intern.
        
        3. Obtain engineering experience
        After receiving your license from the NCEES FE exam, you can apply to work as an engineering intern or engineer-in-training. You must obtain four years of on-the-job training for full licensure.
        
        4. Take and pass the PE exam
        Once you have a minimum of a bachelor's degree and at least four years of experience, you can take the NCEES Professional Engineer (PE) exam to become licensed to work specifically in your discipline. Your career path may also require you to be licensed in more than one state, which means youâ€™ll need to apply for comity licensure in additional states through NCEES.
        
        5. Apply for engineering jobs
        After passing the PE exam and becoming licensed as an engineer, you can begin applying for jobs in your field. Consider exploring industry-specific job boards or job search engines, or use your professional social networks to help you find a position.

        Types of engineers
        While there are various types of engineers, the primary objective across all fields is to improve structures and systems through innovation. Here are some common engineering career options you can pursue based on interest:
        
        Aerospace engineer
        Aerospace engineers are at the forefront of space exploration and aviation. They design and build aerospace technologies, aircraft and spacecraft and often specialize in a particular field such as thermodynamics, aerodynamics or propulsion. Aerospace engineers may also choose to focus on a specific aerospace-related product such as military fighter jets, spacecraft or commercial aircraft.
        
        Automotive engineer
        Automotive engineers are responsible for designing, building and testing products within the automotive industry. For example, an automotive engineer may design and create a smart car that uses an environmentally friendly source as fuel rather than gasoline. This type of engineer may work in a variety of environments and construct vehicles that operate in several different settings.
